                <h2>GPU</h2>
                <p>The GPU (Graphic Processing Unit) is an essential component in computers and electronic devices, responsible for processing and rendering images, videos and graphics. Unlike the CPU, which handles general system tasks, the GPU is specifically designed to perform complex calculations related to on-screen display quickly and efficiently. </p>

                <h2>CPU</h2>
                <p>The CPU (Central Processing Unit) is the heart of any computer or electronic device. It is a microprocessor that is responsible for executing program instructions, processing information and coordinating the activities of other components of the system.</p>

                <h2>RAM</h2>
                <p>RAM (random access memory) is a type of volatile memory used in computers and electronic devices to temporarily store data and programs that are actively being used. Unlike permanent storage such as hard drives or SSDs, RAM allows much faster access to information.</p>

                <h2>Power Supply</h2>
                <p>A power supply is a device that provides the electrical energy necessary for a device, equipment, or system to operate. Its main function is to convert a form of energy (such as electrical energy from the power grid) into a suitable and safe form that the device or equipment can use.</p>

                <h2>Motherboard </h2>
                <p>The motherboard is the main component of a computer or electronic device, and can be considered the "heart" of the system. It is a printed circuit board (PCB) that connects and allows communication between all other components of the computer, such as the processor (CPU), RAM, hard drives, expansion cards, and other peripherals.</p>

                <h2>Liquid Cooler</h2>
                <p>A liquid cooler is a cooling component primarily used in computers and other electronic devices to maintain safe temperatures in components, especially the processor (CPU) or graphics card (GPU). Unlike traditional air coolers, which use fans and fins to dissipate heat, liquid cooling systems use a fluid (usually water or a special liquid mixture) to absorb and transfer heat from hot components to an area where can be dissipated more efficiently.</p>

                <h2>PC Case</h2>
                <p>A PC case is the physical structure that houses all the internal components of a desktop computer. It is the space where the main elements that allow the equipment to function are mounted. Cabinet design and size may vary. Some are more compact (mini ATX, micro ATX) and others larger (ATX, E-ATX), allowing more space to add additional components or improve the cooling system.</p>

                <img src="Imagenes/SSD.png" alt="NVMEM.2">
                <h2>NVME M.2</h2>
                <p>An NVMe M.2 SSD is a high-performance storage device that combines the compact M.2 form factor with the high-speed NVMe protocol, using the PCIe interface to achieve much higher data transfer speeds than SSD-based on SSD. SATA. This results in faster boot times, improved overall performance, and a smoother experience when using the system or applications that require high storage bandwidth.</p>

                <h2>PC Fans</h2>
                <p>PC fans are essential for maintaining a safe temperature in computer components, preventing overheating and improving performance. They come in different sizes, speeds and configurations, and are important for both air cooling (on CPU, GPU and chassis) and other components such as the power supply. In addition, good airflow design and the choice of appropriate fans contribute to the efficiency and durability of the system.</p>
